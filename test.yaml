  # Examples:
    # Case 1
    # In an output dict {'a':1, 'b':2} to grab value of 'a' and assign it to
    # 'first_letter' on an instance of 'data', dependencies would look like:
      # dependencies: ["a", "first_letter"]

    # Case 2
    # In an output dict {'a':{'b':2}} (note that there is a nested dict) to 
    # grab value of 'b' and assign it to 'second_letter' on an instance of 
    # 'data', dependencies would look like:
      # dependencies: ["a", "b", second_letter"]

  # Important!
