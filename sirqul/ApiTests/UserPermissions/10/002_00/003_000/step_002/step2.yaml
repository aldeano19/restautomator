    description: Create a connection | 03 (/consumer/connection/add) |. A connection is created by giving two accounts, one of which is the owner (accountId), and the other is to what account to connect (connectionAccountId). Note that this does not returns the connectionId which is inconvenient for the user since now he needs to search for that newly created connectionId (which BTW isn't working for me as off this moment 08/18/2016).
